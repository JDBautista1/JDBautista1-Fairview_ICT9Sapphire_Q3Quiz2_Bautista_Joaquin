BROOKLYN NINE-NINE is a new single-camera ensemble comedy directed by Dan Goor and Michael Schur, and starring Andy Samberg and Andre Braugher. The film follows Detective Jake Peralta, a talented but carefree detective who is entrusted with the task of chasing down criminals. The precinct's new commanding officer, Captain Ray Holt, reminds Jake to respect the badge. Detective Amy Santiago, who grew up with seven brothers who were all cops, is close behind, aware of the number of arrests she needs to close the gap. Sergeant Terry Jeffords, a linebacker, loses his nerve due to his wife's twin baby girls. Detective Charles Boyle, who idolizes Jake, is the precinct's workhorse, despite not being brilliant or physically gifted. Charles pines for Detective Rosa Diaz, who is both tough and sexy, and is vocally opinionated about everything. Gina Linetti, the eccentric office manager, cleans up everyone's mess.
<br><br>
The film interrogates suspects, arrests perps, and solves murders, but ultimately, it is a workplace comedy that focuses on the men and women behind the badge, singing karaoke, grabbing a beer, and hitting on each other while protecting the fine people of Brooklyn.</p>

I first started Brooklyn 99 when I was 6, and I had immediately fell IN LOVE with it. Though, 6 year old me didn't understand any of the sex references (the sex tape joke, etc), I had still enjoyed it. Everytime I heard a new season was coming out, I would eagerly wait until it was out and ready for me to watch. 
<br><br>
Brooklyn 99 is an amazing show, entertaining, humorous, but it also dives into more serious topics at times, yet it always felt humorous as the jokes were always there. I feel like Brooklyn 99 is a part of me, and it will forever be held in my heart. The running jokes, the chemistry between everyone. This is probably by-far my favorite TV show, ever. It always feels so nostalgic whenever I rewatch it, and I treasure that feeling. This show is extremely special to me, and I suggest you try it too. It gets you hooked quickly, and it keeps you hooked.
<br><br>
They have representation of lgbt+ (Captain Holt, a BLACK police captain, who is GAY! And Rosa Diaz, a bisexual ex-cop, now private investigator.), and talk about things like homophobia or racism at times, and they stand up for their captain (or Terry (Lieutenant, a black lieutenant who was wronged by a police officer before.)). I absolutely love Jake and Amy, they were the cutest couple ever. They truly deserved each other, and I loved watching their story.
<br><br>
The humor is absolutely *chefs kiss* too! Comedic timing is always perfect, and the jokes/inside jokes of the fandom will never get old. Jake and Amy's dynamic makes them so perfect. I love how Jake brings out the best in Amy, and Amy brings out the best in Jake.</p>

After watching all 6 seasons of this awesome sitcom available on Netflix I'm eagerly waiting for season 7& 8's arrival on the platform. Brooklyn Nine Nine is a perfect blend of situational comedy with the perfect array of right fit actors and the shoot locations. Not only is each episode full of comic moments but every individual character makes that role feel alive with their commendable acting.
Show's plot is based on the squad members of New York city's 99th precinct aka Nine Nine wherein the Nine Niners embark on fresh cases, assignments and solve the crimes in a humorous way while leaving up in splits.
<br><br>
Jack Peralta, Amy Santiago, Captain Holt, sergeant Terry, Charles Boyle along with Gina Lenneti and the duo of Hitchcock- Scully make the show a bumper sitcom hit as they never fail to live up to their signature styles while making every minute of the episode worth enjoying to the fullest. The show's best part is the fact that not only it carries the vibes of a comedy show but at the end of every episode it also leaves a strong positive message learnt from those humorous activities. It's indeed a must watch and also one of the bestest shows available on Netflix.

Love love love this show!! Nothing better on TV right now than Brooklyn 99 . If you are debating whether to watch it, just go for it. You won't regret it. It is so clever and so funny. Hands down one of the best TV shows I've ever seen ü§©

 Detailed review: 
What I love about this show is how they have not stereotyped anything. There are countless examples. Their commanding officer is an African American openly gay guy, how often do you see that? Boyle and Jeke are white straight guys but they're not shown as pompous or jerks. Terry is committed and a dedicated family man. The women of the show are so different from each other. Amy is nerdy and quirky and thoroughly embraces it whereas Rosa is fearless and totally contrast to the "lady like" bs we've been fed since our childhood. This is so refreshing to watch I am in love with the writers and the cast.. Higly recommend you watch it too and join the B99 fandom!! 
Certain important topics like racism, sexual harassment , fertility issues, sexuality, adoption , awareness about mental health etc is also being dealt with, with great maturity. Very few shows can be truly hilarious without being offensive. It's a must watch because it's so releavant in today's time and we can all learn something from it while getting entertained thoroughly! What more could you want from a showüíñüëè
